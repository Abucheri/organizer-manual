The most important thing here is the `Is live` checkbox. When your website is ready, click on it and save your page. Tada: your website is now online!

Remember that you don't need to make it "live" to test your website: as an administrator of your website, you'll always be able to access it.

# Order a Workshop box

There are few requirements you need to meet to be able to order a Workshop box :

* You need to have a venue for your workshop
* Application process for your event needs to already be open
* You need to order it at least 6 weeks before workshop to allow for shipping time

When you meet all those requirements, you can order your box [here](https://djangogirls.org/workshop-box/) (you'll need to be logged in admin to see this page).
