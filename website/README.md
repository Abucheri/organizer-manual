# Website

We've built a simple Django application that allows you to create your event's website in a really simple way. You don't have to know how to code to change it but little knowledge about HTML and CSS will be helpful :)

## Want your website?

Send us an email to [hello@djangogirls.org](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org) and give us following details:

- Name of the city
- Name of the country
- Date of the event
- URL of the website (http://djangogirls.org/city)
- Name and e-mail address of team leader
- Names and e-mail addresses of the rest of team (if any)

You'll receive an access to Django Admin. It looks like this:

You can also change every content on your website:

The website will come with some default content that you can adjust to your needs.
