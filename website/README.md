# Administrating your website

We have built a simple Django application that allows you to create your events website in a really simple way. You don't have to know how to code to change it but a little knowledge about HTML and CSS will be helpful :).

Your website you'll be created after you filled a [request](https://djangogirls.org/organize/) for organizing an event and confirmed you read this manual ;)
Don't forget to give us the name and email address of other members of your team if you have any.

All your team will receive an access to the Django Admin panel. It looks like this:

## Editing your event

Editing elements about your workshop can be done by clicking on events list in the left panel. Once you have clicked on your event, you will obtain this page:

Most of the fields are editable but keep those few rules in mind:

* You can change the event date but if you want to postpone or delay an event. If you do that, [keep us posted](mailto:hello@djangogirls.com): don't forget that we can help you if you have any problem ;)
* Cover picture for your event should be under Creative Common Licence. If you want to change it, you can look on [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Don't forget to update photo credit and link.
* You can't edit your team: if you want to add or remove someone, [contact us](mailto:hello@djangogirls.com)

## Managing content

The website will come with some default content that you can adjust to your needs:

* about: catchphrase for your event
* values: general description of your event
* apply: link to application form for attendees
* faq: questions attendees frequently ask
* coach: information for potential coaches and link to application form
* partners: sponsors
* footer: link to social media and Code of Conduct



You can change basic information on

### Adding sponsors

It is possible to add sponsor/partner logos to your website. All you need to do is go to _Core_ -> _Sponsor_ on the admin page and click the _Add sponsor_ button. You should see something like that:

Now you should fill in some fields:

* choose _partners at Django Girls XXX_ (_XXX_ is the name of your city) in _Event page content_
* name of the sponsor in _Name_ field
* choose a picture from your computer with a sponsor's logo. Make sure it is not too big or too small. You can leave this field empty - in this case the name of the sponsor will be displayed instead of the picture.
* add the website address of the sponsor in the _Url_ field
* you can add some extra description, but we usually leave it empty.

That's it!
