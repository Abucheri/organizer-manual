# FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions

Django Girls events have been happening all over the world for a while now, and
we get some repeat questions. Hopefully this page will help you if part of the
planning process has you confused!

## Website and organizing

**Q: Help me, I'm stuck!**

A: We're getting more and more emails and sadly, it's becoming difficult for the Support Team to respond to everyone in a short time. If you're already here, you're on the good track! Check if you can find the answer of your question here. If not, ask other organizers on [Slack](https://djangogirls.slack.com/) or [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-girls-organizers). If no one can help you, [contact us](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org) ;)

### Organizing

**Q: Is it possible to add other people to my team after the event was created?**

A: Yes: send us an [email](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org) and we will add them as co-organizer. 

**Q: How to be sure attendees' computers are ready for the workshop?**

A: If you can, book your venue the evening before the workshop to do an installation party following these [instructions](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/index.html). You can also use this time to invite people from your local Python and Django communities to do lightning talks.
If you can't do that, invite your coaches to meet their group online and send them these [instructions](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/index.html). To be sure they have time to plan this online party, contact your coaches at least a week before the event.

### Swag

**Q: Do you provide swag for events?**

A: We don't for the moment. Don't hesitate to contact other organizers near your location on Slack or Google group: some may have extra from a previous event and may be happy to send them to you!

**Q: I want the cool tattoos, stickers and t-shirts I saw on other events' pictures!**

A: Check our [resources repository](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/resources/) for the material and our [goodies section](http://organize.djangogirls.org/logistics/index.html#goodies) in the organizer manual to learn how to print those.

**Q: Can I give a certificate at the end of the workshop?**

A: We're not a formal training program with examinations so you can't deliver official certificates. However, you can give [cute souvenir certificates](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/resources/tree/ae9756e9e82f30a333d5cfad6176d39e0cdbf594/Design/Certificates) to attendees and coaches.

### Translation

**Q: We just finished to translate the tutorial on Crowdin: what do we do now?**

A: First: congratulations! It's a lot of work that will help your attendees and many learners around the world!
Now that the first part is done, you need someone to proofread your work. If you not sure if someone on your team is a proofreader, [ask us](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org)! When your translation is 100% approved, make a pull request to our tutorial repository. Check this [page](http://translate.djangogirls.org/when_its_ready.html) for more details.

**Q: Is it possible to have a website in two languages?**

A: If you're part of an international conference or think that your event needs to be advertised in two languages, [contact us](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org).

### Application form

**Q: Where can I find all applications submitted for my event?**

A: To see all applications submitted to your event, go to an URL like that: http://djangogirls.org/yourcity/applications/ (remember to replace `yourcity` with your website address). You can find more info about application forms [here](../application_form/README.md).

**Q: We scored applicants, and we have a lot of ties! What do we do?** 

A: Scoring applications is hard! Sometimes when you score, you have a certain percentage of applicants at the top, but then some in the middle who are tied and you can't select the number you need. Our suggestions are: 

- Recruit some more volunteers (maybe former coaches or organizers in other cities) to help you score. More votes lessens the likelihood that you'll have ties. 
- Rescore those applications with your team, to see if a second look at the applicant helps you form a consensus. 
- Accept the applicants who applied first, if there is a tie, and put the rest on a waiting list.  

### Website

**Q: I lost my admin credentials: can you reset them?**

A: You don't need to contact us: just go [here](https://djangogirls.org/account/password_reset/) and follow the instructions ;) 

**Q: Background images are cropped: what went wrong?**

A: You probably forgot to close a HTML tag in one section of `Website Contents`. Check if every `<div>` has a `</div>` and it should fix it ;)

**Q: Why can't I edit my website anymore?**

A: If your event already happened, it's normal. If you want to make another workshop, [contact us](http://djangogirls.org/organize/). If you are in the middle of planning your event, it's not normal but don't worry: send us an [email](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org) and we will fix this!

**Q: I try to add coaches on my website but it's not working: what can I do to fix it?**

A: To add coaches on your website, you need to create a new section on your website. To know more about this, check the [website chapter](http://organize.djangogirls.org/website/index.html) of this manual.

**Q: The application form should be close so why can I still see it?**

A: You can still see your application form because you're the website administrator. If you want to be sure it's closed for applicant, go to your website using the private mode of your browser.

### Next events

**Q: I want to make another workshop!**

A: This is so cool! Let us [know](http://djangogirls.org/organize/) and we will set a new website for you. **Please do not change old website after the event**: it will cause more extra work for us and we will not have previous events listed nicely on our "Event" page.

**Q: Can I use the name Django Girls to make recurring meetups after my workshop?**

A: It shouldn't be a problem but [ask](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org) for our permission first. We would prefer if you named your meetups "Django Girls meetup" to distinguish them from a regular workshop. Your meetup will need to be beginner friendly, have a Code of Conduct (you can use [ours](https://djangogirls.org/pages/coc/) if you want) and be free. 
Don't forget to add your event in our [meetup page](https://djangogirls.org/community/meetups)!

## Django Girls in general

**Q: Isn't Django Girls sexist?**

A: It really isn't, but we can understand why people might feel that way.
We've found that by having a women-only space for learning Python and Django,
women are more comfortable participating. See
[this essay](http://jennifermann.ghost.io/minority-groups-in-tech-is-it-just-reverse-sexism/)
on "[reverse sexism](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Reverse_sexism)" and
Rails Girls to see what we mean. If you're having the knee-jerk reaction that
reaching out specifically to women hurts men, or hurts diversity efforts in
other areas, we encourage you to read
[How I Stopped Worrying and Started Loving Pyladies](https://hynek.me/articles/how-i-stopped-worrying-and-started-loving-pyladies/)
by Hynek Schlawack. One particularly relevant quote is this:

> Outreach programs don’t divide our community. They incubate people which
aren’t comfortable to cope with us from the beginning on and grow our community
in the long term.

> It doesn’t really matter whose fault the initial discomfort is. Whether
they’re being over-sensitive (hint: [they aren’t](http://therealkatie.net/blog/2012/mar/21/lighten-up/))
or whether we’re a bunch of a**holes (I know you aren’t). The facts are these:
if we want underrepresented people to enrich our community, we have to look for
pragmatic ways to get them in. Even if the methods don’t seem sound to us on the
first sight to us.

> “Yes, but…” discussion don’t help. PyLadies – and similar outreach groups –
found a way that works. So be thankful to their organizers for doing this! And
again: if you know of a better way, stop sh*tting on their approach and go for
it! The world isn’t binary; the more approaches, the more diversity, the better.

Also, not all Django Girls events are exclusive to women. Our organizer's manual
encourages organizers to use our materials to put on workshops for women *and*
for mixed-gender groups. We've also open-sourced all of our content, so if you
like our tutorial but don't want to put on a Django Girls event with it, feel
free to fork it, credit us for the content, but rebrand it into something that
works for your goals.

We don't want to get men *out* of programming; we just want to bring more women
*in*. There are already a lot of other bootcamps, workshops, meetups, and groups
that are "mixed gender," but are really mostly men. We've found that by limiting
our workshop to a majority of women participants, women are more comfortable
signing up, asking questions, getting involved, and even staying involved later
on. And that's a good thing!

**Q: I'm an organizer, and someone is saying that my Django Girls event breaks discrimination laws. What do I do?** 

A: First of all, we are so sorry this is happening to you. 

Most of the time when people make this accusation, it's because they don't understand the law. For example, the [UK 2010 Equality Act](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/equality-act-guidance-for-charities/equality-act-guidance-for-charities#about-the-charities-exception) states that if a  nonprofit's "aim is to tackle a particular disadvantage faced by people who share a protected characteristic" then they are allowed to limit their scope only to people who share that characteristic. Django Girls events, even when limited to only women, do not break the law, any more than women's only hacker schools like [Hackbright](http://hackbrightacademy.com/) or [App Camp for Girls](http://appcamp4girls.com/) do. Furthermore, our events are free, and might be best likened to a [PyLadies](http://www.pyladies.com/) educational meetup. 

We recommend you either ignore people who are accusing you of being discriminatory or of breaking the law, or send them one of the links in the response to the above question, "Isn't Django Girls sexist?" If you feel harassed, or are not sure how to respond, reach out to us as [hello@djangogirls.org](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org) and we would be glad to support you however we can.

**Q: Are Django Girls events trans-inclusive?** 

A: Yes! We encourage you to make this explicit on your website. Some events have used this wording: 

> We are trans-inclusive and welcome applications from all women. 

You can add this to your FAQ, or to your event description on your event website. If you'd like to learn more about trans people, you might want to take a look at [this illustrated book about gender](http://www.thegenderbook.com/), [this comic](http://www.roostertailscomic.com/comic/queer-101-third-edition/), or any of the many other introductions to trans issues on the internet. Thanks to the [PyLadies FAQ](http://kit.pyladies.com/en/latest/faqs.html) for pointing us to these excellent resources. 

**Q: Is there a Django Girls for men?** 

A: There doesn't seem to be a need for Django Boys at the moment. But all of our content, including our tutorial and this manual, is open sourced, so if you'd like to start a workshop aimed at another audience, we encourage you to do so! We support you starting an organization that reaches an audience you care about.
