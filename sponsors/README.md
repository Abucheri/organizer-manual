# Sponsors

Getting sponsors on board may sounds scary, but in reality it is not so difficult. Django Girls aims to  a demographic of usually young women who are interested in technology and are possible employees or customers of company that may sponsor your event.

We are looking for sponsors who are active participants in the local technology scene, whether it’s a startup or a big corporation, a non-profit or a government organization.

Also non-traditional technology companies can be approached: beverage brands etc. They all should however have some affiliation or interest in technology.

Django Girls should always be kept non-profit: if there’s money left, it should be used to support the future activities of the attendees. Don’t forget that you don’t need that much funding and even a two-person startup could be very willing to chip in. It maybe the easiest to get many small companies on board.

## What can you offer to sponsors?

The usual offer is to give sponsor opportunity to show their product, offer or company to people who are attending the event. That may include:

- logo, description and link on the website
- banner / roll-up in the venue during the event
- flyers / gadgets distributed to attendees during the event
- a couple of minutes for a sponsor to talk during the event
- e-mail send to attendees after the event (but sent by you on behalf of the sponsor!)

We recommend to talk to sponsors and ask about their goals. We always try to colaborate with our partners and we make sure they get actual value and are happy with the results.

## What can't you offer to sponsors?

The most important is: __not sell your attendees data (names, emails, etc).___ You can send mailing to attendees on behalf of the sponsor, but you can't share private information of people with them.

Sponsors are of course free to hang out during the event and talk to attendees directly.

## How to find sponsors?

If you have time for that, we really recommend creating a simple Sponsorship Offer - a PDF file, a couple of pages. Tell who you are, what Django Girls is (and why it's so awesome!), tell who is going to attend the event and what's the value for them.

You can use Sponsorship Offer we prepared for our first event and modify it to your needs. [LINK HERE!]

Price your sponsorships in a range of 300 - 1000 euros, but remember that even the smallest contributions are important.

### Who can be a sponsor?

- Look for similar events in your city and try contacting companies who support those events
- E-mail or call local companies that are familiar to you
- Post "call for help" on your social media channels, maybe someone will join you!
- Reach to global companies and organizations like [Github](http://community.github.com/) or ask for help [Django Software Foundation](https://djangoproject.com/)
- Python Software Foundation provides a 50$ per attendee grant for Python Educational Program (you are eglible for that!). Send them a grant proposal here: https://www.python.org/psf/grants/
- Create a list of local companies who use Python on daily basis and email them asking for help

### How to contact sponsors?

Simply send them an email like that:

> Hello XXX!

> My name is X X and I am the organizer of Django Girls in City. Django Girls is a global, non-profit organization that helps women get involved into technology and teach them about programming.

> We're doing our first event in City on Xth of X and we would love to get you involved. We're looking for sponsors who can help us cover the costs of food, drinks and others.

> Attached is our sponsorship proposal, but we would love to talk to you more. Please get in touch.

> Have a great day,
X X

### How to transfer money?

Unfortunately, you also have to take care of transfering the money from sponsor to provider. You can do it in three ways:

- If you have your own company, you can just invoice them and pay for the costs. That's probably the simplest way.
- If you don't have your own company, ask local Python community or your friends if they can help with that.
- If this doesn't work either, you can also ask sponsors to pay for food / printing directly.
