# GitHub sponsorship

GitHub can sponsor one Django Girls workshop per city with a 500$ grant. If your event is the first in your city or if the previous ones didn't receive sponsoring from GitHub, you can apply.

Before applying, your event's website [needs to be ready](../website/when_ready.md). When it's the case: go to the [sponsorships requests' page](https://djangogirls.org/sponsor-request/), read the instructions and fill the form.

We send sponsorship requests once every two weeks to GitHub. They will review your request and contact you with an answer. If their answer is positive, they will give you more instructions about how to receive the money.

## Request another sponsorship from GitHub:

You won't be able to apply for a second grant except if your event is happening in a country where it's difficult to find sponsors.

To apply again:

* Prepare a letter explaining why you need another grant
* fill the form on the [sponsorships requests' page](https://djangogirls.org/sponsor-request/)

This second application will be reviewed by GitHub and they will contact you with the results.
