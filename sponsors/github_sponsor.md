# GitHub sponsorship

GitHub can sponsor one Django Girls workshop per city with a 500$ grant. Before applying, your website [needs to be ready](../website/when_ready.md). Then, you need to check if an event already happened in your city and if they received money from GitHub (check their sponsors section). If your event is the first in your city or if the previous ones didn't receive sponsoring from GitHub, you can apply. To do this, follow the instructions bellow.

## For event happening in the US:

Use those instructions **only if** your event is happening in the US or if you will receive GitHub grant on a US bank account.

**When your website is ready and at least one month before your event:**

* Download and fill the **ACH request** and the **W9 form** [available here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxqF-fMgUfHUM0lRSGhBVjNyT1U) (you must be logged with your event email account to access those files). If a company is dealing with your event's invoices and money, they will need to fill those forms, not you.
* Download and fill **GitHub invoice** [available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ozXuqXyIok7p2rFkBHNjSZACp9FPB1yq1Tt9l8BbeEU/edit?usp=sharing). If you don't have a tax number, remove this field. If a company is dealing with your event's invoices and money, they will need to fill this form, not you.
* Name your files like this: CITY_ach.pdf, CITY_invoice.pdf and CITY_w9.pdf.
* [Send us](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org) those **three files**.

The Support Team will be sending invoices bi-weekly to GitHub: they will contact you with the results of your application.

## For event happening anywhere else:

Use those instructions if your event is **not** happening in the US and if you **won't** received GitHub grant on a US bank account.

**When your website is ready and at least one month before your event:**

* Download and fill the **wire request** [available here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxqF-fMgUfHUM0lRSGhBVjNyT1U) (you must be logged with your event email account to access this file). If a company is dealing with your event's invoices and money, they will need to fill this form, not you.
* Download and fill **GitHub invoice** [available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ozXuqXyIok7p2rFkBHNjSZACp9FPB1yq1Tt9l8BbeEU/edit?usp=sharing). If you don't have a tax number, remove this field. If a company is dealing with your event's invoices and money, they will need to fill this form, not you.
* Name your file like this: CITY_wire.pdf and CITY_invoice.pdf.
* [Send us](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org) those **two files**.

The Support Team will be sending invoices bi-weekly to GitHub: they will contact you with the results of your application. We strongly advise you to check your local tax law to learn how to declare this grant.

## Request another sponsorship from GitHub:

You won't be able to apply for a second grant except if your event is happening in a country where it's difficult to find sponsors.

To apply again: fill the wire form, the invoice and add a letter explaining why you need another grant. Send those three files to the [Support Team](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org): This second application will be reviewed by GitHub and they will contact you with the results.
