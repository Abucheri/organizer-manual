# Application form

In this chapter, we will help you create a application form to select your attendees.

# What should I do if something isn't working?

First, you can look at our [FAQ](../faq/README.md) to see if your question isn't already answered there. If not, try to contact other organizers on [Slack](https://djangogirls.slack.com/) or [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-girls-organizers): they'll be happy to help you! If after doing that you're still stuck, contact the [Support Team](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org).
