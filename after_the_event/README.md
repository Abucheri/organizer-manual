# After the event

Congratulations, you MADE IT! And we want to hear all about it :)

## After event TO DO list:

#### Thank everyone

Sending a little thank you note to your attendees, coaches and sponsors is important. Remember to also treat yourself with something you like to relax and decompress -- you did an amazing job!

#### Inform participants where they can look for help

The goal of Django Girls is to shape future software developers, so we shouldn't leave them alone after the event. Let them know about other possibilities of learning you know of:
- Invite them to our Gitter chat
- Give them a list of local events and meetups
- Maybe even organize a follow up meeting to meet for a coffee?:)

#### Invite your participants to our global Django Girls mailing list

We want to build a global community of women who help each other, empower each other and support in learning how to code. Consider inviting all of your participants and coaches to [our Django Girls mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-girls). [Let us know](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org) and we will give you permissions to manage the group so you can invite them via Google Group.

#### Let us know how it went!

We can't wait to hear about your experiences. It'd be great if you could share whatever you learned with us. This list of questions maybe helpful:

1. How many participants attended your event?
2. How many coaches attendeed your event?
3. What was the most important thing you discovered during the workshop?
4. How can we make Django Girls better?

Just send it to us on hello@djangogirls.org :)

#### Share what you learn on Django Girls Organizers group

If you want, you can also share everything with Django Girls Organizer group you already have access to. We're sure that other organizers will appreciate it to!

#### Consider writing a blog post

Share with the world how awesome it was! Consider following [Warsaw](http://blog.djangogirls.org/post/103157984293/django-girls-warsaw-8th-november-2014) and [Krak√≥w](http://blog.djangogirls.org/post/103486728303/django-girls-krakow-11th-november-2014) describing on our blog your whole event. It's a nice way to say thank you to everyone, re-live memories and show your event to the world. If you're planning organizing another Django Girls events in the future, this will also helps you attract sponsors -- you can just send them a link to convince them that Django Girls in your city is awesome!

We would be happy to publish it -- just let us know. You know where to find us :)
