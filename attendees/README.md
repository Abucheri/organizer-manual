# Attendees

The main idea of Django Girls is to bring new people into technology. We are focusing in females, but it is totally fine to organize workshops without any gender requirement.

The tutorial is designed for total beginners, so no programming background is needed. Basically, any person with computer can do the tutorial.

However there are problems. If you organize something for free there is a chance that some people do not appear at all. They didn't invest any time or money, so it is easy for them to simply not come. That's why you should try to find people who really, really care.

The only way you could measure somebody's commitment is their application form. Make sure that it contains questions that will give you necessery hints about the person.

## How people sign up?

### Local events

If you don't plan any Financial Aid for participants at least a month (ideally two or three months) before the event you should open an application process. Give people two weeks to apply and explain why they should be the ones to attend the event, what is their motivation. You can create a simple Google Doc Form or use free service like Wufoo. Send people acceptance/rejection e-mail a week before the event. Make sure they confirm that they will attend.

### International events

If you organize an event and expect having people from many different countries you should start much earlier. There is a chance that you will have a people who needs visa. In this case you need to let people know if they are in at least one month before the event.

#### Visa invitation letter

It is also possible that you will need to provide the invitation letter for the participants who requires visa. It could like this:

> Through this paper we certify  that _[name of participant]_, born _[birth date of participant]_, living at _[country]_, _[address]_, with passport number _[passport number of participant]_, valid from _[date]_ to _[date]_ is invited during the period of [date] to [date] to participate in a DjangoGirls workshops organised by _[name of some legal entity or you]_ with the address: _[address]_; phone: _[phone]_, e-mail: _[email]_.

> _[here you can put some info about who organises the event - if it a part of conference you should put some info about it here]_

> Free food and social activities will be provided by organisers during the period of stay.

> We kindly request to grant a free visa for this particular participant of the Django Girls workshops.

> [your name]

You will need to send this letter (signed!) to the participant. You should also scan the signed papers and send the copy via e-mail.

## Application form

### Google Doc Form

As we have mentioned you can use Google Doc Form for this purpose. You can do that by going to your Google Drive, clicking "CREATE" button and choosing "Form" and "Create and share" option. Then you should fill in all the necessary data: name, layout, etc..

### Questions

What kind of questions you should ask in the form? We have a list of those we used or those we think could be useful for future events.

1. What's your name?
2. Your e-mail address
3. Your phone number. Include your country prefix
4. Where are you from? City, country
5. How ald are you?
6. Your laptop: What operating system do you have? (Windows | Mac OS X | Linux | Other)
7. What is your current occupation? Tell us what you currently do: working, learning or something else?
8. What is your background? Do you have expereince with making websites?
9. Why do you want to attend Django Girls?
10. What are you planning to do to share what you've learned with others?
11. How did you heard about Django Girls? (Facebook | Twitter | From a friend | Other)

#### Financial aid questions

1. Do you need financial assistance to come and stay in [city]
2. What is your current financial situation? Tell us why do you need financial assistance.
3. How much money do you need? Give us an exact amount of euros you need. Try to break

Some questions are not required. For example question 5 (age) is used only for making some statistics later.

It is also a good idea to ask about the previous expereience in fields like: programming (any language), Python, CSS, HTML, Django, databases etc.. Thank's to that you will be able to team up people based on how advance they are.

## How to choose attendees?

If you receive a lot of applications you will face very hard problem: who should you choose. It was very hard for us to decide, but we come up with a way to score applications.

We had four people scoring applications. We used Andrew Godwin's Django app created especially for this purpose. You can find it here: https://github.com/andrewgodwin/grorg. It is a good idea to ask Andrew directly about the app, especially if you have some funding from Django Software Foundation.

### Scoring

To ensure that the first score is not influenced by others, each person scored applications without knowing other three people scores. After making a first scored, one could see other marks.

Order of application was also not determined - we scored in random order, so the probability that one person is scored higher/lower only because she was always on top/bottom of the list, was low.

We scored each application from 1 to 5.

Here is a list of things we took into account when scoring (suggested by Daniele Procida):

* what is the realistic benefit to the applicant?

* what is the realistic benefit to others?

* does the applicant have clear, specific, concrete, realistic ideas about what to do with the knowledge?

* does the applicant have clear, specific, concrete, realistic ideas about how she will share it?

* do I feel the applicant really, really wants this opportunity, or is it just an interesting offer to her?

* what is a overall value-for-money, if the applicant is asking for funds?

* what is my overall feeling about the application?

As you can see, there were a lot of points we took into account when scoring. It was very, very hard to get in. If the application was not very detailed - the chance to be accepted was very low. But writing a lot was not a recipe for success. We looked for concrete ideas and commitments in applications.

Look for a diverse group: the more different people are, the more crazy / fun / creative ideas will happen during the event.

The final tip: follow you heart :) Choose those who convince you the most, those who need it, those who may want to change their lives and follow this path as a career. Choice is yours, but it's never easy.

## Acceptance/reject e-mails

Make sure you write to all people who have applied - not only to those who get in. It is as easy as sending the same thing to all e-mail addresses. Just make sure to put addresses as Bcc, so they are hidden to other people who receive the e-mail.

It's a good idea to create a waiting-list. We informed them that they didn't get in, but they were very close and asked them if they will be interested to join if some spot will be free.

## People resigning

We had a number of people who said they will not manage to come even though they confirmed their attendence before. The waiting list worked very well in this scenario.

Be prepared to have some last minute (one day before the workshops) quitter. It's normal. As long as you have people who can use the spot - it is fine.
