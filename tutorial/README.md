# Tutorial

For the purpose of this workshop we've decided to write our own tutorial which you can find here: [tutorial.djangogirls.org](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/).

We're biased :) but we really recommend using this for the workshop. It's tested, corrected by a lot of people and you can fit it into 8 hours workshop.

## Tutorial topic

In the tutorial everyone builds their own blog. Of course, changes from that are really appriciated as it helps women to understand even more what's happening under the hood.

## Idea

The idea behind the tutorial is that you're learning by making lots of mistakes and then fixing them. Like in life, right?

We do this to get people familiar with errors and bugs which happen to every programmer all the time. We want people not to be afraid of them, but learn how to read, understand and fix them. Don't skip this part, it's important!

This technique also allows people to better understand how it actually works. If you just copy and paste the code, you can't learn how it works. If you need really think about it - this is when it starts to click.

## Can I use my own resource?

Yes, but make sure you've tested it before on someone.

## I found a bug in the tutorial!

Go to our [Github repository](http://github.com/DjangoGirls/tutorial), fork it and send us a pull request. Every help is really appriciated.
