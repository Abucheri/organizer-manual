# Step by step

Before we go into details, let's have a look on a bigger picture of organizing Django Girls event.

You should organizing start at least 3 months before the event will take place. It gives you a safe amount of time to make sure everything runs smoothely. Of course, the actual amount of work could be fitted into 40-50 hours of work total, so if you spread it into 3 months period, you can totally do it in your free time.

Let's how it looks on the timeline:

### 3 months before

- Announce a [website](website/README.html), Twitter or Facebook
- Start promotion of Django Girls
- [Start looking for sponsors](sponsors/README.html)
- [Start looking for a venue](logistics/README.html)
- [Start looking for coaches](coaches/README.html)

### 2 months before

- [Announce application process for attendees](attendees/README.html)
- Reach out to local press, universities and actively promote the event
- Have a team of coaches ready
- Secure a venue
- Start looking for catering
- Still look for sponsors

### 1 months before

- Announce your coaches on the website

- Organize a dinner / meeting for your coaches and make sure they read Coach's manual and are familiar with the [Tutorial](tutorial/README.html).
