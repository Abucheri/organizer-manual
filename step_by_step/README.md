# Step by step

Before we go into details, let's have a look on the bigger picture of organizing a Django Girls event.

You should start organizing at least 3 months before the event will take place. It gives you a safe amount of time to make sure everything runs smoothly. Of course, the actual amount of work could be fitted into 40-50 hours of work total, so if you spread it into 3 months period, you can totally do it in your free time.

Let's see how it looks on the timeline:

### 3 months before

- __Apply for Django Girls organization__
- Announce a [website](../website/README.html), [Twitter or Facebook](/promotion/README.html)
- [Start promotion of Django Girls](../promotion/README.html)
- [Start looking for sponsors](../sponsors/README.html)
- [Start looking for a venue](../logistics/README.html)
- [Start looking for coaches](../coaches/README.html)

### 2 months before

- [Announce application process for attendees](../attendees/README.html)
- [Reach out to local press, universities and actively promote the event](../promotion/README.html)
- [Have a team of coaches ready](../coaches/README.html)
- Secure a venue
- Start looking for catering
- [Still look for sponsors](../sponsors/README.html)

### 1 months before

- Announce your coaches on the website
- [Choose attendees and inform them](../attendees/README.html#how-to-choose-attendees)
- Organize a dinner / meeting for your coaches and make sure they read the [Coach's manual](http://coach.djangogirls.org/) and are familiar with the [Tutorial](../tutorial/README.html).
- Make sure attendees confirmed their attendance
- [Make sure all the logistics are figured out](../logistics/README.html)

### 1 week before

- Confirm with attendees one last time that they're still planning to attend the event! Make some last minute replacements if someone cancels.

### After the event

- Follow up with global Django Girls and let us know how it went! [Here are some ideas](../after_the_event/README.html).
- __Be proud of yourself <3__

All of this is further explained in the chapters on the left but this is a bigger picture.
