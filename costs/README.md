The costs below are estimated for 30 participants, 10 coaches - but they may vary a lot. Prices may also vary depending on the place. All in all You should be able to organise an event easily for a little over a thousand euros.

- __Coach dinner__ - Thank your coaches for hard work and have a place to meet to talk about the event. Around 20 euros per coach = 200€.

- __Venue__ - From our experience, it's easy to get a place for 40 people for free. Try your local startups, companies or hackerspaces and coworking spaces. It can be really expensive, so any help from local community is super helpful. 0€.

- __Afterparty__ - Meet with your coaches and attendees after the workshop to relax, decompress, have some fun and make some friends. Everyone can pay for their own drinks. 0€
