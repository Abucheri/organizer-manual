# Checklists!

## Day of your meetup checklist:

- If you have a Twitter account, tweet about your meetup again and get people excited.
- Arrive early to your meetup venue.
- Ask your host to add direction signs with your meetup name in appropriate locations.
- Greet everyone and make them feel welcome.
- If you have any speakers, help them get set up and feel welcomed.
- If you need help, ask around.
- Check your event page comments regularly: people having problems can try to contact you there.

## When your meetup is over

* If you had any speakers, send them thank you email and ask them to post their slides in your event's comments.
* Send a thank you email to the company who hosted you.
* If you took pictures, post them on your meetup page. If you plan to do that, always ask people if they're okay with being on a picture that will be published online.
* If you have a Twitter account: do a tweet to thank everyone who came and your sponsor. If your speakers posted their slides online, retweet them.
