# Venue and sponsors

You don't need a big budget for your meetup: you only need to be able to cover your meetup's fees.

Don't hesitate to reuse left-over stickers, badges or decoration from your previous event. If you want to print more stickers, you can find Django Girls stickers' templates in our [resources repository](). 

If you plan to do a bigger follow-up, like an all day event, you may need to raise money again. In that case, check the [sponsor chapter]() and don't forget to mention your successful workshop ;)

## When should the group meet?

Depending on what you're planning to do, you can meet in the evening, half a day or more. Feel free to chose the rhythm you prefer but we would recommend meeting at least once a month.

## Finding a venue

### looking for a venue

Like for Django Girls workshops, this could be one of the hardest parts.

Start by asking companies you're close to: it could be the company you work for, your friends' companies, a previous sponsors, etc.

If it's not working, contact other tech companies in your town. Job boards, tech conferences websites, and other tech meetups are also a good way to start.

Try to find a place that's relatively central or well connected to public transportation and accessible to people with disabilities: if you're not sure what it means, check our [accessibility chapter](../accessibility/README.md).

### Logistics

Depending on what you're planning to do, here's a list of what you may need:

- Electricity and enough power outlets for everyone.
- A good Internet connection: make the network name and password available. If possible, write it somewhere visible so you don't have to repeat it all the time.
- A projector: check if your venue have adapters available or don't forget to bring yours ;)
- Food and/or beverages: if it's included with your venue, check if there are non-alcoholic and vegetarian options.

### Can't find a venue?

If you can't find a company to host your meetup, try something different: meet in a cafe, a hackerspace, a library with a group room or meet in a parc and do a picnic. Networking is also an important part of meetups and it's better to meet every month than to skip one ;)

## Why so many people didn't come?!

A lot of people RSVPed but didn't show? Don't worry, that's one of the downsides of free meetups. Do a head-count at each event to know how many people usually attend your meetup.

If something went wrong, listen to feedback and make changes. Try to have a different topic and speakers for each meetup: if you don't do that, people will get bored and won't come anymore.
