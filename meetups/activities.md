## Talks

Depending on your meetup and talks duration, you can plan one or more talks. 

### Lightning talks

Lightning talks are a session of short talks (5 minutes): it's a great way to cover multiple topics during one meetup. If you're not familiar with this format, you can watch [those lightning talks]() from DjangoCon US 2016.

### "Call For Proposal" workshop

You can also provide a space for people to work on their talk proposals, try them, or repeat their accepted talks.
