# Follow-ups and meetups

After conducting a successful workshop, you may want to keep the energy going and create a group of learners that would meet regularly.

Services like [Meetup]() provide what you need to get started. This service costs money but it will help you can create events where people can register, contact members easily, promote your sponsors, and more.

Basic rules for organizing a Django Girls meetup:

- You can create a meetup only after having successfully organized a workshop.
- **[Contact us](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org)** if you want to use the name Django Girls for your meetup.
- You **need a Code of Conduct** and you need to put a link to it on your meetup's page. We recommend you to use [our Code of Conduct]().
- Keep your event beginner friendly.

To help you get started, here are some examples of Django Girls meetups and follow-up: [Django Girls Seoul Code Camp]() and [Django Girls Amsterdam meetup]().
