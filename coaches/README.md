# Coaches

To make the workshops sucessful, you need to have good coaches. You don't necessarily need someone with a huge Python/Django knowledge. You are looking for people who can teach others and can inspire them to learn.

If you run the event as a part of Python/Django conference you will proobably have no problem with finding people willing to help. In case of stand-alone event - you should contact the local Python/Django community. There are also people who like to travel and help out with this kind of event.

Make sure you have some backup plan if one or more of your coaches will not appear.

## Call for coaches

It is important to start looking for coaches as soon as possible. Create a separate form for them. Ours looked like this:

1. What's your name?
2. What's your e-mail?
3. Your Github username if you have one.
4. What operating systems are you comfortable with? As much as possible we would like to give you a group that work on the same operating system as yours. (Windows | Mac OS X | Linux | Other)
5. What languages do you speak?
6. Will you have time before the workshops to help your group (3 people) install Python and Django via Google Hangout/Skype/e-mail?
7. Will you have time to meet us and other coaches a day before the workshops?
8. Do you have any previous experience with teaching others? Tell us about it.

## How to choose the coach?

Coaches are important, so it is good they are people you trust and you know they are firendly, patient and willing to help. You need somebody who will invest their time before, during and after workshops.

If the potential coach is not responding to e-mails for a couple of days, is not willing to meet other coaches or help with installation part, then you probably want somebody else.

It would be also lovely if you could find some coaches among previous Django Girls attendees!

## Meta coach

We think it is a good idea to have one more experienced coach on site. Not all of your coaches need to be super advanced. In case of some serious problems, the meta coach could help with solving them.
