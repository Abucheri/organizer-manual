# GDPR and Data Privacy Guide
**The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a
 set of rules that came into effect on May 25th, 2018.** 
 
It regulates the use of data by organisations.
It applies to any organisation that stores or processes
 any data relating to individuals inside the European 
 Union (EU). 
 
 Since we have events in Europe, it is important 
 for Django Girls Foundation and organizers across 
 the globe to comply with GDPR as it has legal 
 implications. We therefore recommend all organizers 
 to comply with GDPR as it protects users' data, 
 irrespective of their location. 
 
 This guide therefore applies to all organizers 
 as they deal with the sensitive data of fellow 
 organizers, attendees and sometimes, sponsors 
 from the EU region.
