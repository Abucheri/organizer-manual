[A Developer’s Guide to GDPR that won’t make you sweat](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/a-developers-guide-to-gdpr-that-won-t-make-you-sweat-4f1f7f1d9c8b) by [Mags Allen

**The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a
 set of rules that came into effect on May 25th, 2018.** 
 
It regulates the use of data by organisations.
It applies to any organisation that stores or processes
 any data relating to individuals inside the European 
 Union (EU). 
 
 Since we have events in Europe, it is important 
 for Django Girls Foundation and organizers across 
 the globe to comply with GDPR as it has legal 
 implications. We therefore recommend all organizers 
 to comply with GDPR as it protects users' data, 
 irrespective of their location. 
 
 This guide therefore applies to all organizers 
 as they deal with the sensitive data of fellow 
 organizers, attendees and sometimes, sponsors 
 from the EU region. Every event organizer should 
 ensure their event is GDPR compliant to avoid 
 chances of being sued by either applicants or
 sponsors.
 
# Storage of Data

> Protect the data you store and only keep what you need.

When you customise the application, ensure that you 
only ask for data that you need to run your event 
successfully. This data should be protected and 
not shared with people who do not participate in 
ensuring the successful delivery of the workshop. 
For example, coaches should not be given email 
addresses or phone numbers of attendees who are not in their group
as they do not need to contact them before or 
after the workshop.

Coaches and organizers need to be informed that 
they should protect personal data of attendees and
other coaches/organizers and not share it amongst
themselves without the consent of the person 
involved.

You also need to ensure that you get
consent from the applications to send them any mass 
email before and after the event. Should you also 
want to invite them to other meet-ups after the 
workshop, please ensure that
