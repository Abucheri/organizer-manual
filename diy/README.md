# DIY: how to make a workshop beautiful on budget

We strive to make each Django Girls event a one of the kind experience. If you look at the pictures from the past workshops you'll notice amazing decorations, photo booths, flowers, cupcakes and many other exciting things. This one of the things that makes Django Girls unique, fun and exciting and we love it. 

However, we don’t want you to have an impression that to make a successful Django Girls event you have to have all these things and buy decorations, flowers, make videos and so on. Yes, we believe they make Django Girls different and special, but we also don’t want you to spend loads of money on things that are expensive and not necessary.

This chapter will give you some tips and examples, how - with a little of DIY and good ideas and hacks - you could create something magical with very little money. 

## Copyrighted materials

If you found an awesome design (picture, font, drawing, etc) you would love to use during your event, **don't forget to check the license**! Only use open source materials or pay for the license. If you can't find the license of something, please don't use it.

## Decorations

There are different ways to make the workshop look amazing. If you are a crafty type, preparing decorations would be very easy (but might take some time). If you hate this kind of stuff, we have some tips for you, too.

### Balloons

* Many of the Django Girls events order big, [gold letter balloons](https://www.flickr.com/photos/djangogirls/15624332819/in/album-72157649335413325/). In on-line shops or on eBay you could find them for 2-6 dollars each (depending on shop and size of the balloon). Order in advance so it will come in time for your event. If you have smaller budget, instead of having whole “Django Girls” (or any other longer text), you could go for something shorter, like: "YAY".
* If you are on tight budget - don’t use helium. Most of the time it’s pretty costy and you would need to order or rent a whole bottle and then return it. You could just fill the balloons with air and glue or hang them on the string from a wall or ceiling. Other problem with helium is that rubber balloons very often loose the helium much quicker than metallic balloons, so if you have perfect balloons for installation party, they might look sad next day at the end of the workshop. 

### Flowers

* If you want some flowers at your workshop, don’t go to the florist - it will cost fortune! It’s better to find a flower market nearby and go there in the morning - especially if you want a bigger amount of flowers. 
* If you don’t have a flower market nearby, you could go for something smaller. You could buy a pack of small jars (normal jars for making marmolade or jams) - it should be possible to find very cheap and simple ones - and put one flower inside each jar. It’s not about the quantity, it’s about making a small, pleasant detail to show people you care.

### Fairy lights

* During winter months (but not only), nothing makes better impact than fairy lights. It should be easy to find and order very cheap ones on-line. If your workshop is after Christmas, you could buy the lights when they are discounted, too.


### Bunting and garlands

* A good and impressive way to decorate a space is to hang a bunting. You could buy one very cheaply, but you could also make one yourself: all you need is a string, paper, scissors and glue. 
* It’s also fairly easy to make a [garland](https://www.flickr.com/photos/djangogirls/15643374408/in/album-72157649308746176/) on your own. All you need is a nicely shaped punch hole cutter (star, heart etc.) and the sewing machine. Choose the big punch hole cutter: 3 or more cm in diameter - and use some cheap paper or old magazines and punch as many as you can. Than all you need to do is to sew through them (like shown [here](http://www.elli.com/blog/paper-heart-garland/)). If you don’t have a sewing machine - ask around, maybe one of your friend, your parents or grandparents have it? In organization of many Django Girls whole families where involved in making decorations. 
* If all above seems too complicated, you could also go for something easy, like buying crepe paper, cut the long pieces and hang them like [this ones](https://www.flickr.com/photos/djangogirls/17139247632/in/album-72157651606478126/) - to have this amazing effect, all you need to do is twist the crepe ribbon many, many times and it looks lovely.


### Table cloths

* It’s amazing if you have tablecloths on the tables, but it is very unlikely that you own so many of them to have enough for 10 or more tables. You could either have different tablecloth on each table, if you like it, rent it (but that costs a lot) or simply use something instead: like a brown paper you could decorate with markers: write names of participants and coaches, write some nice things like: “You can do it” and so on. If you buy white or gold markers - it will do the job. The good thing about brown paper tablecloth is that it could be also used as a place to make notes by participants or doodle. 


### Other ideas

* If your budget is very limited you could use post-it notes and arrange them on the wall in a heart or other shape you like. It's very cheap and it's easy to make.
* You could also use cut with punch hole cutter stars, hearts or anything else and sprinkle them on the workshop tables - it is easy and [looks lovely](https://www.flickr.com/photos/djangogirls/15643378428/in/album-72157649308746176/).
* Use venue wisely - is there something in the workshop location that could act as a decoration? Bin bags you could put in one location, creating a room for people to chill and to take a break? Or big black or whiteboard you could use to [write or draw something](https://www.flickr.com/photos/djangogirls/15643639597/in/album-72157649308746176/)?
* If you are crafty, you would like to make bigger decorations, you could make flowers out of crepe [like these ones](https://www.flickr.com/photos/djangogirls/15643641437/in/album-72157649308746176/). There are different tutorials available online that explains how to prepare something like that..

## Cupcakes and other treats

Cupcakes are one of the things that is present on many Django Girls workshops, but it doesn’t mean you have to have them or spend a fortune to have the most fancy ones. If you want to have some treats for participants and do that on budget, you could:

* Prepare cookies yourself or ask your friends for help. 
* If you know a friendly bakery who might be interested in sponsoring some sweets - it’s worth to ask them if they would like be one of the sponsors.
* You could try to find sponsors just for that - if the company would like to be more visible, they could order cupcakes with their logo or little flags with the name of their company. 
* You could skip cupcakes and prepare some veggies and fruits instead. Just buy a bunch of apples, pears or any seasonal tasty fruits that are easy to eat and place them on each table. You could also prepare carrots - it’s a lovely and healthy snack. This is also an amazing and easy option for people with special dietary requirements.


## Photography

Nothing is better than beautiful photos made during the workshop. But having a professional photographer is a costy thing and very often you don’t have a budget for it. Our tip is to ask around - does any of your friends have a camera and like to make pictures?

You could also arrange your own photo booth, instead of having a professional one. All you need is a person with a camera (and ideally tripod), nice background (could be piece of cloth or paper or just a wall if there is nothing on it), good light (place it near window for example). Then you could make some [props on your own with piece of paper](https://www.flickr.com/photos/djangogirls/16801129968/in/album-72157651606478126/). You could browse internet and find loads of free printables. You could order props online quite cheaply. 

Don't forget to ask attendees and coaches if they want their picture taken. If you can, create two badges: one for those who want to be in the pictures, one for those who don't.

## Swag

You don’t always have enough money to order T-Shirts with “Django Girls” print for every participant. We have some tips how to prepare something nice for each participant and coach and not spend a fortune on that.

* In general, ordering bags will be much cheaper than ordering T-shirts. If you don’t have enough money for t-shirt, but you have some funds - it’s much cheaper version. However, very often the cheapest bags could shrink in laundry, so you should check the quality of the bags before ordering 50 of them.
* If bags are too expensive, you could prepare small packets for participants. Buy a pack of brown paper or white paper breakfast bags, which should be very, very cheap and put a handful of candies and stickers from sponsors inside. You could also put other small things: confetti (you could make some on your own with a small punch hole cutter!), a handwritten notes with “Thank you for coming!” or anything else you could think of. Tie with a ribbon or use sticker to close the bag. It will look lovely!

Remember: it’s not about having the most expensive and most impressive gifts for everyone. It’s about showing people - attendees and coaches - that you care. Just to make it personal. 


## Sharing

Last, but not least is sharing. If one of the workshop had these beautiful fairy lights, maybe they would be happy to send them to you, so you could reuse them for your workshop? There are a number of workshops that shared decorations, stickers and swag. Maybe a workshop had some “Django Girls” bags leftovers and you don’t have a budget to print yours? Just ask at mailing list or on Slack channel for organizers!

To create an amazing atmosphere, you don’t need tons of money. With a little bit of effort and help of your friends, you could create something amazing on very tight budget. Make sure to share your ideas with other organizers, too.
